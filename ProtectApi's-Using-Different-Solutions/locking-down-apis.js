/**
 * Even though our code is rather locked down by now, our attacker is ruthless and will stop at nothing. 
 * The next attack vector weâ€™ll examine is a dependency of the library code. 
 * This dependency exists in the form of a global called window.fetch. 
 * This is a browser-provided function for making HTTP requests. 
 * Even though it's built-in to the browser it can be modified, much like how the attacker was able to replace the getAuthorization method on the object we had returned.
